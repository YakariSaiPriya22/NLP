# NLP
NLP is a field of Artificial Intellegence that gives the machines the ability to read, understand and derive the meaning from human languages.
NLTK --> Natural Language Tool Kit --> open-source package

Tokenisation--> using tokenisation we can break a paragraph into sentences or words.
Stemming--> It is a process of reducing the derived words into their base or root form. 
            PorterStemmer is the library used for stemming
            The word produced after Stemming may not have any meaning, used when meaning of the word is not much needed for analysis
            Ex: Spam Detection
Lemmatisation--> It is a process of reducing the derived words into a meaningful words.
             WordNetLemmitizer is the library used for lemmitization
             We use this when meaning of the word is important for analysis
Vectorizing the Data--> It is process of encoding text into numeric form
N-Gram : It captures the letter/word is likely to follow the adjacent word
Bag of Words: Describes the presence of words in a text data
TF-IDF : Describes the importance of the words, here uncommon words are given more importance than common words
